# Knowledge Representation in Prolog

Author: Rodrigo S. Cortez Madrigal

This project provides a Prolog-based knowledge base management system. It allows for the representation, querying, addition, modification, and deletion of classes, objects, properties, and relations within a hierarchical structure.

## Knowledge Representation

### Class Structure

- `class(ClassName, ParentClass, PropertyList, RelationList, ObjectList)`: Represents a class in the knowledge base.
    - `ClassName`: The name of the class.
    - `ParentClass`: The parent class of the class.
    - `PropertyList`: A list of properties associated with the class.
    - `RelationList`: A list of relations associated with the class.
    - `ObjectList`: A list of objects belonging to the class.

### Prolog Built-in Predicates

- `findall`: Finds all solutions to a query.
- `member`: Checks if an element is a member of a list.
- `append`: Concatenates lists.
- `select`: Removes an element from a list.
- `exclude`: Removes elements from a list that satisfy a condition.

## Main Predicate

### `main/0`

The main predicate initializes the knowledge base, performs various operations (addition, modification, deletion), and saves the updated knowledge base.

- Steps:
    1. Load the I/O module.
    2. Load the initial knowledge base from `KB.txt`.
    3. Perform addition operations.
    4. Perform modification operations.
    5. Save the updated knowledge base.
    6. Perform query operations.
    7. Perform deletion operations.
    8. Save the final knowledge base.
    9. Terminate the program.
